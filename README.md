# Summary

The project is to improve the visualization in the [police stop report](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/SF-Find-Neighborhoods/pty2-tcw4) of San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) and to provide our own EAD and corresponding visulization based on the police stop database collected by [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) to answer the How, Who, When, and Where of police stops in San Francisco.
